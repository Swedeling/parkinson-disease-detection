    Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical
  observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization
  of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches
  may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that
  are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify,
  leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor
  symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions.
  Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an
  early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the
  diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been
  implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients
  with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other
  Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data
  modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis
  and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature
  review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and
  IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for
  relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of
  their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and
  associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for
  adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical
  decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of
  PD.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Diagnosing Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) necessitates monitoring symptom
  progression. Unfortunately, diagnostic confirmation often occurs years after
  disease onset. A more sensitive and objective approach is paramount to the
  expedient diagnosis and treatment of persons with PD (PwPDs). Recent studies
  have shown that we can train accurate models to detect signs of PD from audio
  recordings of confirmed PwPDs. However, disparities exist between studies and
  may be caused, in part, by differences in employed corpora or methodologies.
  Our hypothesis is that unaccounted covariates in methodology, experimental
  design, and data preparation resulted in overly optimistic results in studies
  of PD automatic detection employing sustained vowels. These issues include
  record-wise fold creation rather than subject-wise; an imbalance of age
  between the PwPD and control classes; using too small of a corpus compared to
  the sizes of feature vectors; performing cross-validation without including
  development data; and the absence of cross-corpora testing to confirm
  results. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of these methodological
  issues in the automatic detection of PD employing sustained vowels. We
  perform several experiments isolating each issue to measure its influence
  employing three different corpora. Moreover, we analyze if the perceived
  dysphonia of the speakers could be causing differences in results between the
  corpora. Results suggest that each independent methodological issue analyzed
  has an effect on classification accuracy. Consequently, we recommend a list
  of methodological steps to be considered in future experiments to avoid
  overoptimistic or misleading results.%
