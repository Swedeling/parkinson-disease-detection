abstract = {ABSTRACT Most patients with movement disorders have speech impairments resulting from sensorimotor abnormalities that affect phonatory, articulatory, and prosodic speech subsystems. There is widespread cross-discipline use of speech recordings for diagnostic and research purposes, despite which there are no specific guidelines for a standardized method. This review aims to combine the specific clinical presentations of patients with movement disorders, existing acoustic assessment protocols, and technological advances in capturing speech to provide a basis for future research in this field and to improve the consistency of clinical assessments. We considered 3 areas: the recording environment (room, seating, background noise), the recording process (instrumentation, vocal tasks, elicitation of speech samples), and the acoustic outcome data. Four vocal tasks, namely, sustained vowel, sequential and alternating motion rates, reading passage, and monologues, are integral aspects of motor speech assessment. Fourteen acoustic vocal speech features, including their hypothesized pathomechanisms with regard to typical occurrences in hypokinetic or hyperkinetic dysarthria, are hereby recommended for quantitative exploratory analysis. Using these acoustic features and experimental speech data, we demonstrated that the hyperkinetic dysarthria group had more affected speech dimensions compared with the healthy controls than had the hypokinetic speakers. Several contrasting speech patterns between both dysarthrias were also found. This article is the first attempt to provide initial recommendations for a standardized way of recording the voice and speech of patients with hypokinetic or hyperkinetic dysarthria; thus allowing clinicians and researchers to reliably collect, acoustically analyze, and compare vocal data across different centers and patient cohorts. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

ABSTRACT = {Diagnosing Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) necessitates monitoring symptom progression. Unfortunately, diagnostic confirmation often occurs years after disease onset. A more sensitive and objective approach is paramount to the expedient diagnosis and treatment of persons with PD (PwPDs). Recent studies have shown that we can train accurate models to detect signs of PD from audio recordings of confirmed PwPDs. However, disparities exist between studies and may be caused, in part, by differences in employed corpora or methodologies. Our hypothesis is that unaccounted covariates in methodology, experimental design, and data preparation resulted in overly optimistic results in studies of PD automatic detection employing sustained vowels. These issues include record-wise fold creation rather than subject-wise; an imbalance of age between the PwPD and control classes; using too small of a corpus compared to the sizes of feature vectors; performing cross-validation without including development data; and the absence of cross-corpora testing to confirm results. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of these methodological issues in the automatic detection of PD employing sustained vowels. We perform several experiments isolating each issue to measure its influence employing three different corpora. Moreover, we analyze if the perceived dysphonia of the speakers could be causing differences in results between the corpora. Results suggest that each independent methodological issue analyzed has an effect on classification accuracy. Consequently, we recommend a list of methodological steps to be considered in future experiments to avoid overoptimistic or misleading results.},

ABSTRACT={Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of PD.}
