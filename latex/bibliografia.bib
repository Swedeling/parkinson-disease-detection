abstract = {Parkinson’s disease consists in the degeneration of the mesencephalic black substance, affecting the dopaminergic vias. Its causes are varied, including exposure to pesticides, genetic factors and, one of the most influential ones, age. Given the decrease in dopamine levels, the most common symptoms are the appearance of tremors and muscle rigidity. Due to the rigidity of the muscles, the patient has voice alterations which have great potential for non-invasive and early diagnosis of the disease. In addition, considering the low cost of the sound recorder respect to the clinical studies, this approach allows the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease in a large number of people. Recent works, which present the analysis of voice recordings through Convolutional Neural Networks, show high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. Convolutional Neural Networks use a Multilayer Neural Network to classify convolutional feature vectors. In order to improve the training time of the classifier, in this paper the use Extreme Learning Machines are proposed. Experiments considering 4 types of spectrograms with AlexNet, VGG-16, SqueezeNet, Inception V3 and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Networks models. In the experiments, hit rate, training and testing time, sensitivity and the specificity indicators of all the neural architectures involved in the work are objectively compared. It is shown that the Extreme Learning Machine have a high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease but with reduced training time.}

abstract = {Extreme learning machine is an algorithm that has shown a good performance facing classification and regression problems. It has gained great acceptance by the scientific community due to the simplicity of the model and its sola great generalization capacity. This work proposes the use of extreme learning machine neural networks to carry out the classification between Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy individuals. The descriptor used corresponds to the feature vector generated applying the local binary Pattern algorithm to the grayscale spectrograms. The spectrograms are obtained from the audio signal samples from the considered repository. Experiments are conducted with single hidden layer and multilayer extreme learning machine networks comparing the results of each structure. Results show that hierarchical extreme learning machine with three hidden layers has a better general performance over multilayer extreme learning machine networks and a single hidden layer extreme learning machine. The rate of success obtained is within the ranges presented in the literature. However, the hierarchical network training time is considerably faster compared to multilayer networks of three or two hidden layers.}

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) can cause many non-motor and motor symptoms such as speech and smell. One of the difficulties that Parkinson’s patients can experience is a change in speech or speaking difficulties. Therefore, the right diagnosis in the early period is important in reducing the possible effects of speech disorders caused by the disease. Speech signal of Parkinson patients shows major differences compared to normal people. In this study, a new approach based on pre-trained deep networks and Long short-term memory (LSTM) by using mel-spectrograms obtained from denoised speech signals with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for detecting PD from speech sounds is proposed. The proposed model consists of four steps. In the first step, the noise is removed by applying VMD to the signals. In the second step, mel-spectrograms are extracted from the enhanced sound signals with VMD. In the third step, pre-trained deep networks are preferred to extract deep features from the mel-spectrograms. For this purpose, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models are used as pre-trained deep network architecture. In the last step, the classification process is occurred by giving these features as input to the LSTM model, which is designed to define sequential information from the extracted features. Experiments are performed with the PC-GITA dataset, which consists of two classes and is widely used in the literature. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the latest methods in the literature, it is seen that it has a better performance in terms of classification performance.}
