abstract = {Parkinson’s disease consists in the degeneration of the mesencephalic black substance, affecting the dopaminergic vias. Its causes are varied, including exposure to pesticides, genetic factors and, one of the most influential ones, age. Given the decrease in dopamine levels, the most common symptoms are the appearance of tremors and muscle rigidity. Due to the rigidity of the muscles, the patient has voice alterations which have great potential for non-invasive and early diagnosis of the disease. In addition, considering the low cost of the sound recorder respect to the clinical studies, this approach allows the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease in a large number of people. Recent works, which present the analysis of voice recordings through Convolutional Neural Networks, show high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. Convolutional Neural Networks use a Multilayer Neural Network to classify convolutional feature vectors. In order to improve the training time of the classifier, in this paper the use Extreme Learning Machines are proposed. Experiments considering 4 types of spectrograms with AlexNet, VGG-16, SqueezeNet, Inception V3 and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Networks models. In the experiments, hit rate, training and testing time, sensitivity and the specificity indicators of all the neural architectures involved in the work are objectively compared. It is shown that the Extreme Learning Machine have a high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease but with reduced training time.}

abstract = {Extreme learning machine is an algorithm that has shown a good performance facing classification and regression problems. It has gained great acceptance by the scientific community due to the simplicity of the model and its sola great generalization capacity. This work proposes the use of extreme learning machine neural networks to carry out the classification between Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy individuals. The descriptor used corresponds to the feature vector generated applying the local binary Pattern algorithm to the grayscale spectrograms. The spectrograms are obtained from the audio signal samples from the considered repository. Experiments are conducted with single hidden layer and multilayer extreme learning machine networks comparing the results of each structure. Results show that hierarchical extreme learning machine with three hidden layers has a better general performance over multilayer extreme learning machine networks and a single hidden layer extreme learning machine. The rate of success obtained is within the ranges presented in the literature. However, the hierarchical network training time is considerably faster compared to multilayer networks of three or two hidden layers.}

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) can cause many non-motor and motor symptoms such as speech and smell. One of the difficulties that Parkinson’s patients can experience is a change in speech or speaking difficulties. Therefore, the right diagnosis in the early period is important in reducing the possible effects of speech disorders caused by the disease. Speech signal of Parkinson patients shows major differences compared to normal people. In this study, a new approach based on pre-trained deep networks and Long short-term memory (LSTM) by using mel-spectrograms obtained from denoised speech signals with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for detecting PD from speech sounds is proposed. The proposed model consists of four steps. In the first step, the noise is removed by applying VMD to the signals. In the second step, mel-spectrograms are extracted from the enhanced sound signals with VMD. In the third step, pre-trained deep networks are preferred to extract deep features from the mel-spectrograms. For this purpose, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models are used as pre-trained deep network architecture. In the last step, the classification process is occurred by giving these features as input to the LSTM model, which is designed to define sequential information from the extracted features. Experiments are performed with the PC-GITA dataset, which consists of two classes and is widely used in the literature. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the latest methods in the literature, it is seen that it has a better performance in terms of classification performance.}

abstract = {The computerized detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) will facilitate population screening and frequent monitoring and provide a more objective measure of symptoms, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Dysarthria is an early symptom of the disease and examining it for computerized diagnosis and monitoring has been proposed. Deep learning-based approaches have advantages for such applications because they do not require manual feature extraction, and while this approach has achieved excellent results in speech recognition, its utilization in the detection of pathological voices is limited. In this work, we present an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PD from the voice recordings of 50 healthy people and 50 people with PD obtained from PC-GITA, a publicly available database. We propose a multiple-fine-tuning method to train the base CNN. This approach reduces the semantical gap between the source task that has been used for network pretraining and the target task by expanding the training process by including training on another dataset. Training and testing were performed for each vowel separately, and a 10-fold validation was performed to test the models. The performance was measured by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that this approach was able to distinguish between the voices of people with PD and those of healthy people for all vowels. While there were small differences between the different vowels, the best performance was when/a/was considered; we achieved 99% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and 89.6% AUC. This shows that the method has potential for use in clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of PD, with the advantage that vowel-based voice recordings can be performed online without requiring additional hardware.}

ABSTRACT = {We propose the implementation of transfer learning from natural images to audio-based images using self-supervised learning schemes. Through self-supervised learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn the general representation of natural images without labels. In this study, a convolutional neural network was pre-trained with natural images (ImageNet) via self-supervised learning; subsequently, it was fine-tuned on the target audio samples. Pre-training with the self-supervised learning scheme significantly improved the sound classification performance when validated on the following benchmarks: ESC-50, UrbanSound8k, and GTZAN. The network pre-trained via self-supervised learning achieved a similar level of accuracy as those pre-trained using a supervised method that require labels. Therefore, we demonstrated that transfer learning from natural images contributes to improvements in audio-related tasks, and self-supervised learning with natural images is adequate for pre-training scheme in terms of simplicity and effectiveness.},
